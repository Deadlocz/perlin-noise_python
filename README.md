# perlin-noise_python
small perlin noise generation project in python using pygame for display

## Usage
Start the program and enter a seed if you want, it'll take a bit and then generate a map.

After generating a map it'll try to generate the next frame every half second (tho probably not, due to it being inperformant)
if that is done, it will say 'passed' in the terminal.

in the next frame the whole map will be shifted by one chunk
